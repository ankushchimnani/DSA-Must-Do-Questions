## **Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, or 2s**

Given an array A[] consisting 0s, 1s and 2s. The task is to write a function that sorts the given array. The functions should put all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.



#### **Sample Input**
	array = {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2}

	

#### **Sample Output**
	array = {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}

#### **Sample Explanation**
	The array on sorting gives the resultant array as shown in the output  

#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(N), where N is the size of the array.
#### **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(1),Auxilliary Space  

#### **Constraints**
	 n == nums.length
	 1 <= n <= 300
	 array[i] is 0, 1, or 2.

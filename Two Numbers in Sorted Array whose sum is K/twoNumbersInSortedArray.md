## **Two Numbers in sorted array whose sum is K**

Given a sorted array of integers nums and an integer K, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to K.



#### **Sample Input**
	array = [2,7,11,15], K = 9
	

#### **Sample Output**
	[0,1]

#### **Sample Explanation**
As seen from the sample input, the values at index 0 and 1 add up to the required value of 9. Therefore, the output is [0,1].

#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(N),where N is the size of the array. 

#### **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(1), constant space complexity.  

#### **Constraints**
	 2 <= nums.length <= 103
	-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
	-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
